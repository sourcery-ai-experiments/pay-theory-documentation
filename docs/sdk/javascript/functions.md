The function returns a Promise that will contain an object with a key of `type`. You can expect the following values for `type`:
- [`SUCCESS`](#success-response): The transaction was successful and the transaction details will be in the `body` key.
- [`FAILED`](#failed-response): The transaction failed and the details will be in the `body` key.
- [`CONFIRMATION`](#confirmation-response): The transaction requires confirmation and the transaction details will be in the `body` key.
- [`CASH`](#cash-response): The transact call successfully generated a barcode and the barcode details will be in the `body` key.
- [`ERROR`](#error-response): The transact call had an error while processing and the error details will be in the `error` key.

While generating the Barcode it will use the geoloaction to return a map url for the users specific location.

If this is the first time it has been requested the user will have the opportunity to accept or decline the request.

***
## confirm

This function is used to confirm a payment that has been created and required the confirmation step.
