## The Fee Matrix Object

This object is used to calculate the fees that are charged to the payor. `card`, `ach`, and `cash` are the main fee objects that are used to calculate the fees for each transaction type.  

The other objects are used to calculate fees for specific card brands or card types and are optional. If they are not set, the fees will be calculated using the `card` object.

Card brands can only be used to charge different fees when using the `MERCHANT_FEE` fee mode.
