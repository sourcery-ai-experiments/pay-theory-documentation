# Authorization  

An authorization is used to reserve funds on a card for a future transaction.  It is not a charge, but it does reserve the funds on the card for a period of time.  The authorization will expire after a period of time if it is not captured.  

*Authorizations are currently only available for certain processors.  Please contact Pay Theory for more information.*
