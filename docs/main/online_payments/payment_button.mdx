# Payment Button
This guide will walk you through the steps to create a payment button that will take users to a paytheory checkout page.

## 1. Import the SDK
You need to use the Pay Theory Web SDK. This is available by adding the below script into your web header. This button will open a hosted checkout page that will allow the user to select a payment method and complete the payment.

The SDK URL can be found in the Pay Theory portal under the settings tab as the SDK Import URL.

```
<script src={SDK Import URL}> </script>
```
***

## 2. Add Pay Theory element to your Html
This div is used to mount an iframe that will include a checkout button. You need to add the Pay Theory elements to your HTML. You can place these elements anywhere in your HTML and the SDK will place the button in the correct place. 

```html
<div id="pay-theory-checkout-button" ></div>
```
*** 

## 3. Prepare the checkout details
You will need to put together the details of the checkout. This includes the amount, payment name, and any other details you want to pass to the checkout.

```jsx title="javascript"
//Amount passed in is in cents
const AMOUNT = 1000

const PAYMENT_METADATA = {
  "student-name": "Jane Doe"
};

// Parameters that you will pass in to configure the checkout page that opens when the button is clicked.
const CHECKOUT_DETAILS = { 
  amount: AMOUNT, 
  paymentName: “user-name”

  acceptedPaymentMethods: paytheory.CARD_ONLY, 
  payorId: "pt_pay_XXXXXXXXX", 
  metadata: PAYMENT_METADATA,  
  recurringId: "pt_rec_XXXXXXXXX", 
}
```
These are the parameters that you can pass into the `checkoutDetails` object to customize the checkout page that opens when the button is clicked.

### Required parameters:

|Key                |type               |description                                                                                |
--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| payorId                 |string             |The Pay Theory id for the payor that will be used for the payment. If this is not passed in, a new payor will be created.|
| metadata                |JSON               |The metadata that will be passed into the transaction.|

## 4. Create the Button
Using the button function, you can make the button. Send the style object, the checkout details, and the action-handling routines. To manage the button's actions, you can write functions. Among them are `onReady`, `onClick`, `onSuccess`, `onError`, and `onCancel`.
```jsx title="javascript"
const handlePayment = () => {
  // Function that will be called when a payment is successful
  const ON_SUCCESS = (response) => {
    console.log("Payment Successful");
    console.log(response);
  };
// Create the button
paytheory.button({
    apiKey: "PT_API_KEY",
    checkoutDetails: CHECKOUT_DETAILS,
    style: STYLE_OBJECT,
    onReady: ON_READY,
    onClick: ON_CLICK,
    onSuccess: ON_SUCCESS,
    onError: ON_ERROR,
    onCancel: ON_CANCEL
});
};
```

These are the parameters that you can pass into the `button` function to customize the payment session.
You pass a single object into the function with the following keys.

### Required parameters

:::note Setting up a button for multiple payments
The button session will only enable a single payment. If you want to enable multiple payments, you will need to clear the button from the DOM and create a new button.
